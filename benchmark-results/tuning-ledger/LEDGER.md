# Other-Artifacts First-Class Tuning Ledger

Tracking iterations for `learning_path`, `code_tour`, and `workflow_story`
toward the same "first-class" quality bar that cliff notes v13 hit.

## First-class target (mirrors cliff notes v13)

- Section count: hit the DEEP target (learning_path 10–15, code_tour 10–15,
  workflow_story 9)
- Confidence mix: ≥66% HIGH, no more than 1 LOW in the whole artifact
- Hallucination rate: ≤5%
- Identifier density: ≥3 backtick identifiers per section on average
- Evidence grounding: ≥2 real files cited per section
- Content depth: ≥800 bytes / section average

## Baseline model for iteration

`claude-haiku-4.5` on OpenRouter — cheapest reliable cloud model, fast
enough to iterate. Final cross-model validation against top-5 once
targets are hit.

## Ledger rows

| Artifact | Iter | Change | Sections | H/M/L | Halluc% | avg_ids | avg_bytes | deep_s | Status |

| learning_path | 1 (after ports v1) | coerce + enforcement + hints | 1 | 0/1/0 | 0 | 13 | 15324 | 79 | still broken (parse) |
| learning_path | 2 (after-fixes) | +depth casing +max_tokens=16384 | 8 | 0/8/0 | 0 | varies | ~2.1k | 96 | MEDIUM (depth bug) |
| learning_path | 3 (after-fixes4) | +depth-filter polling → true DEEP | 15 | 2/4/9 | 58.3 | varies | varies | 390 | halluc too high |
| learning_path | 4 (tightened) | file-path discipline in prompt + dir grounding in analyzer | 15 | 2/4/9 | 31.2 | varies | varies | 374 | halluc better, HIGH low |
| code_tour | 0 (BEFORE ports) | baseline | 8 | 0/8/0 | 0 | 0 | 239 | 11 | no grounding |
| code_tour | 1 (after ports v1) | hints in prompt | 8 | 0/8/0 | 0 | 1.1 | 242 | 11 | still MEDIUM (depth bug) |
| code_tour | 2 (after-fixes4) | +depth fix → true DEEP | 15 | 9/5/1 | 0 | n/a | 256 | 93 | solid |
| code_tour | 3 (tightened) | analyzer fix only | 15 | 6/8/1 | 0 | varies | varies | 91 | slight regression in HIGH |
| workflow_story | 0 (BEFORE ports) | baseline | 7 | 7/0/0 | 0 | 0 | 975 | 44 | already high |
| workflow_story | 1 (after-fixes4) | +depth fix → 9-section DEEP | 9 | 8/0/1 | 0 | varies | varies | 54 | first-class |

## Iteration 5 (post-parse hallucination filter)

| Artifact | Sections | H/M/L | Halluc% | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| learning_path | 15 | **10/3/2** | **0.0** | ✅ first-class bar hit |
| code_tour | 15 | 1/14/0 | 0.0 | regressed on HIGH count (run variance?) |
| workflow_story | 9 | 7/1/1 | 0.0 | small regression but still strong |

Key finding: the post-parse filter that drops LLM-invented file_paths
from `step.file_paths` took learning_path from 58% → 31% → **0%**
hallucination and lifted HIGH count from 2 → 10 of 15 steps. That's
the biggest single-change quality gain in this tuning sweep.

## Iteration 6 (code_tour prompt tighten, first pass)

| Artifact | Sections | H/M/L | Halluc% | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| learning_path | 15 | 3/2/10 | 0.0 | ⚠ strict filter dropped untracked-but-real files, pushed steps below min_files=2 floor |
| code_tour | 15 | **14/0/1** | 0.0 | ✅ first-class — "name 2+ symbols" prompt stabilised HIGH count |
| workflow_story | 9 | 2/4/3 | 0.0 | LLM hit an unterminated-JSON parse error; needs a deeper look |

Key finding: the strict exact-match hallucination filter regressed
learning_path because the `KnowledgeSnapshot` doesn't ship the full file
list — only files touched by tracked symbols. Real-but-untracked files
(e.g. `internal/db/migrations.go` next to a tracked `store.go`) were
dropped and their steps fell below the min_files=2 floor. Fix in
commit `2e92442`: path is grounded if its parent directory appears
anywhere in the snapshot. Keeps inventions like `internal/worker/
queue.go` blocked (no `internal/worker/` anywhere) while accepting
untracked files in real directories.

## Open questions / remaining work

- `learning_path` — re-validate after directory-aware filter
  (commit 2e92442). Target: 10/3/2 or better with halluc ≤5%.
- `code_tour` — first-class achieved once; run validation against
  the hallucination-filter commit to confirm no regression.
- `workflow_story` — investigate the haiku JSON truncation; the
  max_tokens ceiling may need the same 16384 bump that learning_path
  and code_tour got.
- Top-5 sweep pending per task #51.
