# Changelog

All notable changes to SourceBridge are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Theme: **ask smarter, not harder.** A new agentic retrieval loop, a
server-side deep-QA orchestrator, and a hybrid search backbone plugged into
the deep pipeline. Measured quality gains on a 120-question parity
benchmark with LLM-as-judge.

### Added

- **Agentic retrieval loop.** Phases 0–4.5 ship a tool-dispatching agent
  synthesizer that swaps passive retrieval for an explicit plan → call
  tools → cite answer loop. Tools include `search_evidence`,
  `find_tests`, and a query decomposition pre-pass. The agent
  capability probe runs unconditionally at startup and is wired into
  the REST server. Paired-benchmark result vs Phase-3 baseline:
  **+10.00% overall quality**, with another **+3.33%** added by the
  Phase-5 quality push.
- **Anthropic prompt caching on the agentic loop** (quality-push Phase 1)
  — repeated tool-call framing is cached across turns, cutting token
  cost without changing answer fidelity.
- **Smart classifier + seed-context routing** (quality-push Phase 2) —
  the classifier picks a retrieval strategy per question class instead
  of running the full pipeline for every query.
- **`find_tests` agent tool** (quality-push Phase 3) — lets the agent
  pull in the test file that exercises a symbol when the question is
  about behavior, not structure.
- **Query decomposition pre-pass** (quality-push Phase 4) — gated to
  architecture-class questions where sub-question routing actually
  helped the judges; skipped on everything else to avoid latency
  churn.
- **Server-side deep-QA pipeline.** A new `internal/qa` orchestrator
  runs the deep ask flow on the API side with readiness gating and a
  CTA fallback when the pipeline can't complete. Exposed as a
  GraphQL `ask` mutation, a `POST /api/v1/ask` REST endpoint, and an
  MCP `ask_deep` tool. CLI auto-picks the server path when
  `/healthz` advertises QA. The old `cli_ask.py` deep mode now prints
  a deprecation warning.
- **Deep pipeline uses hybrid search.** The deep-QA path now calls
  the hybrid `search.Service` (Phases 1–6 from the prior release) as
  its retriever instead of the legacy grep path — requirements,
  files, symbols, and signals all flow through one ranked backbone.
- **QA parity benchmark.** 120 curated questions across architecture,
  execution flow, domain concepts, and requirements grounding, with
  an LLM-as-judge runner (`benchmarks/qa/`). Baseline vs candidate
  arms, per-question judgments, per-arm environment capture, and a
  rollup report. Seed script + per-question repo-path mapping let
  the candidate run inside a k8s worker pod or against a remote
  instance.
- **Fallback-compat CI lane** — a dedicated workflow that exercises
  the pipeline with the agentic loop disabled so the fallback path
  can't regress silently.
- **Ops docs** — `docs/admin/server-side-qa-rollout.md` with staged
  canary instructions and rollout decisions finalized (Q5.6 / Q6.1 /
  Q7.1); `docs/admin/telemetry-collector-qa-fields.md` for the
  collector-side field additions that QA adoption needs.

### Fixed

- **`find_tests` schema**: Anthropic's API rejects `anyOf` at the
  `input_schema` root. The tool definition now expresses the variant
  shape without the root-level union so cloud and local models
  accept the same schema.
- **Smart-classifier fabrication**: dropped `file_candidates` from
  the classifier's seed prompt, which was inviting the model to
  invent plausible-but-non-existent file paths.
- **Agentic deadlines** iteratively tuned — **60 s / 30 s** first,
  then **90 s / 45 s** wall/per-turn after the initial setting
  truncated legitimate long answers. Decomposition sub-loop budget
  bumped **30 s → 60 s**.
- **Agentic `search_evidence` init order** — the tool was being
  registered before the search service was ready on startup; moved
  service init before QA wiring so the tool is usable on the first
  request.
- **Citation fallback widened** to scan every tool-result turn, not
  just the final turn, so an answer stitched together from earlier
  tool calls still carries the evidence citations forward.

### Changed

- **Decomposition gate narrowed to architecture-only** (post-Phase 5).
  The quality-push evaluation showed decomposition helped
  architecture questions but hurt execution-flow and concrete
  questions; the gate now reflects that.
- **Default prod posture** recorded in
  `thoughts/shared/plans/` as the surgical config — Phase-5
  decomposition + architecture gate + agentic loop + hybrid search
  is the baseline unless overridden.
- **Q5.1–Q5.6 deep-QA migration series** — `discussCode` context
  ported into the orchestrator, GraphQL `ask` adapter added,
  synthesis routed through the LLM job orchestrator, telemetry
  fields reserved for QA adoption, CLI and REPL re-pointed at the
  server path.

### Infrastructure

- `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` added to `.gitignore`.
- Judge docs pointed at the canonical
  `automation/anthropic-api-credentials` secret path used by other
  benchmarks.
- QA benchmark reports live in `benchmarks/qa/reports/` alongside
  the runner output so rollouts can diff arms over time.

## [0.8.0-rc.1] — 2026-04-21

Release candidate for 0.8.0. Theme: **token streaming end-to-end**, first-class
requirement CRUD, and the VS Code extension relocated into this repository
so the full stack lives in one place.

### Added

- **Streaming discussion answers** via a new `AnswerQuestionStream` gRPC
  alongside the existing unary `AnswerQuestion`. The worker yields LLM
  content deltas as they're generated; the API relays them through
  **two delivery surfaces**:
  - **MCP**: `explain_code` progress notifications carry a `delta` field
    that the VS Code plugin appends to the running answer in real time.
  - **REST SSE**: new `POST /api/v1/discuss/stream` endpoint emits
    `event: token` / `event: done` / `event: error` frames. The web UI's
    Discuss page consumes them through `src/lib/askStream.ts`.
  No more 30–90 s of "Thinking…" on a local model — users see tokens as
  they land.
- **Requirement CRUD** mutations on GraphQL: `createRequirement` (with
  auto-generated `REQ-<uuid>` external IDs and uniqueness enforcement) and
  `updateRequirementFields` (partial patch semantics — explicit nulls
  clear fields, omitted fields preserve them). Matching web flows:
  CreateRequirementDialog, inline EditRequirementCard, RemoveRequirementDialog.
  `acceptanceCriteria` round-trips through the full stack.
- **VS Code extension (0.3.0)** now lives in `plugins/vscode/`. Packaged via
  `make package-vscode` / `make install-vscode`. Features: code-action
  lightbulbs, `Cmd+I` streaming chat, `Cmd+K N` field guides, `Cmd+Shift+;`
  scoped palette, Change Risk sidebar tree, inline requirement CRUD,
  opt-in telemetry, ARIA labels throughout. Status-bar connection indicator
  with auto-reconnect.
- **Namespace-local Redis** support for MCP session storage (HA across
  replicas). Enterprise deployment now ships its own Redis manifest so
  MCP sessions don't collide with OSS.

### Fixed

- **Qwen thinking-disable on Ollama**. The previous implementation only
  sent the llama.cpp-specific `chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking":
  False}`, which Ollama ignores — Qwen 3.5 MoE burned its entire
  `max_tokens` budget inside an unemitted thinking block and returned
  empty content with `stop_reason=length`. Now also sends the `/no_think`
  directive in the user message for Qwen-family models; both backends work
  without runtime detection.
- **Orchestrator stale-inflight claim release**. An API pod that failed a
  job in-memory during a worker-pod startup race kept the dead job's ID
  in its inflight registry, so every identical request deduped to that
  failed job forever until the pod restarted. `Enqueue` now detects
  terminal states on claim collisions and retries with a fresh job.
- **arm64 release binaries** now build on a native `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
  runner. Cross-compiling from amd64 with `CGO_ENABLED=1` was failing on
  tree-sitter's arm64 assembly.
- **Release packaging** skips the `*.dockerbuild` provenance artifact so
  the release job doesn't retry 5× on a flaky artifact download.
- **SemVer prerelease tags** (hyphenated suffixes like `-rc.1`, `-beta.2`,
  `-alpha`) are now auto-flagged as prerelease on GitHub.

### Changed

- **Trash retention worker** matured into Phase 1 complete — telemetry,
  lint clean, SurrealDB round-trip fixed (dropped the unsupported COMMIT
  wrap; fixed the SCHEMAFULL NONE-field backfill trap in migration 030).
- **Knowledge artifact regeneration** is now delta-driven: a shadow
  pipeline computes which scopes' evidence actually changed on reindex
  and only those are flagged stale. Replaces the scorched-earth
  full-rebuild behavior.
- **Selective knowledge-artifact invalidation** on reindex — unchanged
  scopes stay READY.
- **GraphQL extension timeouts** raised to 180 s for LLM operations
  (`DiscussCode`, `ReviewCode`, `ExplainSystem`, `GenerateCliffNotes`,
  `GenerateLearningPath`, `GenerateCodeTour`). Previous 10 s ceiling was
  cutting off the server mid-response.

### Infrastructure

- Enterprise Dockerfiles live in-tree so Tekton builds them alongside
  OSS images without a parallel repo.
- Web, worker, and Go CI pipelines now all pass cleanly on the same push.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-19

**Runtime reconfiguration and API cleanup.**

### Added

- **Runtime orchestrator reconfiguration** — change `MaxConcurrency` on a
  live instance without a restart. The Admin Monitor page surfaces a
  provider-aware recommended value based on the model size + hosting
  mode, and `handleUseRecommended` wires the chosen value into the orchestrator.
- **Provider-aware concurrency recommendations** — `MaxConcurrency`
  suggestion per provider × model class (small local, large local MoE,
  cloud API), calibrated against the bench harness.
- **Enterprise report RPC shim** — reserves the wire surface for the
  commercial report-generation feature without the OSS build carrying
  any of the enterprise logic.
- **Knowledge proto dual-field enums** — additive, deprecation-friendly
  replacements for the legacy string-encoded enum fields. GraphQL
  deprecations flag the old names.
- **Article addendum infrastructure** for benchmark write-ups, including
  a top-5 sweep across `learning_path` / `code_tour` / `workflow_story`
  and a parallel other-artifacts harness for slow local models.

### Fixed

- **Worker CI and release pipeline** — mypy debt cleared, Go data races
  fixed, Python lint clean, unused code removed.
- **Hallucination scorer** — no more trailing-slash false positives on
  path citations.
- **Workflow story generation** — raised `max_tokens` to match DEEP
  artifacts elsewhere so long walks don't truncate.
- **Path filter** accepts known-directory citations (previously rejected
  directory-only paths as hallucinations).
- **Shared knowledge parsing helpers** promoted to a reusable module so
  each generator doesn't reinvent the same regex dance.

### Changed

- **Frontend auth fetch paths consolidated** — all API calls now go
  through one helper with consistent header handling and error
  classification.
- **Error handling and shutdown paths tightened** — graceful drains,
  fewer leaked goroutines, cleaner logs.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-16

**Telemetry, Docker Hub, and community infrastructure.**

### Added

- **Anonymous install telemetry** from the Go API to
  `https://telemetry.sourcebridge.ai/v1/ping`. Opt-out respected; provider
  kind and version reported. Minimal dashboard for the maintainers to
  understand deployment spread.
- **Docker Hub distribution** — `docker compose up -d` with the official
  `sourcebridge/sourcebridge-api` image is now the recommended quickstart.
- **Community files** — `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant),
  `SECURITY.md`, CI lint fixes, standardized issue templates.
- **Fast / Deep repo QA modes** — the CLI and REPL `ask` command now
  exposes two grounding profiles so casual queries don't pay for full
  repo context unnecessarily.

### Fixed

- CLI `ask` grounding quality — better evidence selection, fewer
  hallucinations, clearer error surfaces.
- Local compose and CLI AI paths — several configuration mismatches
  between `dev` and `compose` environments.
- Telemetry version reporting previously stamped "dev" even on tagged
  builds.

### Changed

- Removed the hosted telemetry service from the OSS repo (it lives in
  its own collector repo now, so this repo has no server code it
  shouldn't).
- Benchmark and demo seed data excluded from the OSS distribution to
  keep the repo lean.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-14

**First-run demo experience.**

### Added

- **`./demo.sh`** — one command that starts SourceBridge, indexes a
  44-file sample `acme-api` TypeScript project, and generates cliff
  notes, code tours, and architecture diagrams. Drops new users directly
  into a fully-populated workspace without a long cold index.
- **Going-to-production guide** in `docs/` with backup / restore,
  capacity planning, and hardening checklists.
- **Screenshots in README** — overview, cliff notes, search, generation
  queue — so people can see what SourceBridge does before installing.

### Fixed

- **OSS worker logging** — job lifecycle events now emit correctly with
  the expected structure.
- **Worker Surreal fallback** — handles the "DB not reachable at startup"
  case without panic.
- **Viewport layout** — page-level scroll removed when the shell grid is
  active; the sidebar and main column now scroll independently. No more
  double scrollbars.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-13

Minor follow-up to 0.4.1 with a handful of persistence fixes.

### Added

- **Saved generation-mode overrides** per scope, so a repo set to DEEP
  for cliff notes doesn't forget across restarts.
- **Repeatable generation-mode benchmark harness** for regression
  testing model swaps.

### Fixed

- Generation-mode persistence race on rapid scope switches.
- Benchmark hardening: flake-free sampling, consistent seeding, fair
  provider comparisons.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-13

**Knowledge generation reliability + queue visibility.**

### Added

- **Prioritized refinement and generation-mode controls** — the queue
  now favors interactive work over maintenance sweeps; repo-level
  reindex no longer starves user-triggered cliff notes.
- **Monitor rollup for reused summaries** — aggregate cache-reuse stats
  surface on the Admin Monitor page so operators see how much work is
  served from the summary cache vs. regenerated.
- **Cache-reuse stats as first-class job fields** (leafHits, fileHits,
  packageHits, rootHits). Previously buried in message strings; now
  queryable via GraphQL and visible on every job card.
- **Knowledge timeouts driven by app config** — operators can tune the
  per-scope ceilings without recompiling.

### Fixed

- **Summary-node cache writes** — race between writers caused the cache
  to silently drop hot entries under load.
- **Queued knowledge jobs heartbeat** behind slot gates so the reaper
  doesn't mark legitimately-waiting jobs as stale.
- **Noisy repo segmentation** — the monitor's health signals got
  confused when a single repo had hundreds of sibling scopes. Segmented
  so each repo gets its own bucket.

### Changed

- **Understanding-first artifact rendering** — the field guide view
  now leads with the repository-understanding score and derived
  recommendations rather than a flat list of generated artifacts.
- **Vector-based logo** across all assets (dashboard, README, docs).

---

## [0.4.0-pre-report-pipeline] — 2026-04-10

Preview checkpoint for the reports feature-flag work. Not a normal release.

### Added

- Reports feature plan committed to `thoughts/` — professional
  multi-repo report generation, audience targeting, evidence system,
  appendices, level-of-effort estimation, PDF rendering. No runtime
  behavior yet; this tag marks the start of the implementation arc.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-10

### Changed

- **Reports feature moved to enterprise-only.** OSS ships without the
  report-generation path; the enterprise build re-injects it via the
  `MCPToolExtender` / enterprise-routes hook.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-10

**Comprehension engine polish and confidence honesty.**

### Added

- **Deep-mode cliff notes** use repo-level analysis when generating a
  scoped (file or symbol) cliff note — scoped output now has access to
  the full repo understanding, not just local evidence.
- **Deep-mode workflow stories** also inherit cliff-notes analysis, so
  walk-throughs cite the same evidence the summary cited.
- **Bulk repository import** — paste a list of URLs to import many
  repos in one go.

### Fixed

- **Test coverage 100% bug** — the understanding-score calc clamped
  coverage to 100% even when fewer tests existed than symbols.
- **Confidence rules for cliff notes** — summaries ARE direct evidence
  (they were being treated as derivative, inflating the confidence
  badge on citation-light repos).
- **Progress-bar advancement** during generation for every artifact
  type (several types had been stuck at 0% until completion).
- **Workflow story richness** — higher base confidence, fuller content
  blocks, fewer null-field crashes (`entry_points` null-safety, full
  tracebacks in error logs).
- **Render prompt rewrite** — richer output, fewer in-flight flickers
  when a job is mid-generation and another poll arrives.
- **Refresh buttons** for code tour / learning path actually call
  `refreshArtifact` (they were previously no-ops on the UI side).
- **Stale job reaper** also marks linked artifacts as failed, so a
  stuck job doesn't leave a zombie artifact that looks READY in the UI.
- **Null-safety** across artifact dict lookups (`.get(key, []) or []`
  pattern applied consistently).

### Changed

- **Understanding-score horizontal layout** — fits better on narrow
  repo-detail cards and reads left-to-right.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-10

**Comprehension Engine + production hardening.**

This release absorbed two months of comprehension-engine work, the
multi-phase summary-tree rollout, and the initial production-grade
hardening pass (53 commits over the 0.1.0-alpha baseline).

### Added

- **Hierarchical summary tree** — leaf / file / package / root
  comprehension layers with per-level max-token budgets and evidence
  propagation.
- **Scoped field-guide generation** — cliff notes / learning paths /
  code tours / workflow stories at any scope (repo / file / symbol /
  requirement).
- **Generation mode picker** — Fast vs. Medium vs. Deep, per scope,
  with live token and latency estimates.
- **Admin Monitor page** with the LLM job queue, live generation
  progress, reuse stats, and a breaker for runaway providers.
- **Semantic search** against the repository graph, grounded in the
  indexed symbol vectors.

### Fixed

- Initial production-grade reliability pass: retries, context-cancel
  plumbing, bounded goroutines, graceful shutdown, breaker on
  consecutive compute failures.
- Null-safety, type-narrowing, and traceback surfacing across the
  worker's generation codepaths.

---

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-03

**First public release.**

Initial alpha: repository indexing via tree-sitter, a gRPC worker with
Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic LLM providers, a GraphQL API, a Next.js
web UI, and the bones of the cliff-notes generation pipeline. Enough
to demo; rough at the edges, with production hardening explicitly
deferred to 0.2.0.
