"""Artifact renderers.

A renderer takes a :class:`SummaryTree` and produces a final artifact
(cliff notes, learning path, code tour, workflow story). Renderers are
strategy-agnostic — they consume the tree shape, not knowledge of how
it was built — so the same CliffNotesRenderer works against a
HierarchicalStrategy output today and a RAPTOR/GraphRAG output later.

Each renderer does one final LLM call: it feeds the model the root
summary plus a small number of the most substantial child summaries
and asks for structured JSON sections that match the existing cliff
notes UI contract. This keeps the final prompt small enough for any
model even when the original repo was huge.

Write a JSON array of {section_count} section objects.

Each section object has these keys:
  - "title": one of the required section titles listed below (string)
  - "content": a detailed markdown paragraph of 8-12 sentences. Name specific \
    files, components, functions, and patterns. Explain HOW things work, not \
    just WHAT they are. Target 180-220 words per section — do not stop short \
    once the section has been introduced; elaborate on the named abstractions, \
    cite each file with the specific function or type defined there, and \
    describe at least one concrete interaction between components. (string)
  - "summary": a single-sentence takeaway (string)
  - "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low" (string)
  - "inferred": true if you're extrapolating beyond the summaries (boolean)
  - "evidence": array of objects with keys: source_type, source_id, file_path, \
    line_start, line_end, rationale. Every evidence entry must include an actual \
    repository file path from the summaries above. Include at least one entry \
    per file that appears in the section evidence plan for the section you are \
    writing (unless that file is genuinely off-topic for the section).

Required section titles (produce every one, in this order):
{required_sections}

Confidence rules (mechanical — apply exactly):
- Set confidence to "high" and inferred to false when you cite AT LEAST THREE \
  real repository file paths from the section evidence plan AND name at least \
  three specific functions, types, methods, or test identifiers from them.
- Set confidence to "medium" when you can cite at least one real repo file path \
  but are extending beyond what the summaries make explicit.
- Set confidence to "low" only when no file in the section evidence plan is \
  relevant and you must rely on general inference.
- Do NOT self-downgrade below high when the mechanical criteria above are met — \
  the criteria are the ground truth.

Citation rules:
- Treat the section evidence plan as the primary routing guide. For each \
  section, include at least one evidence entry for every file path that appears \
  in that section's plan line (unless the file is genuinely off-topic for the \
  section you're writing). Evidence entries MUST use real file paths from the \
  plan or the subsystem/file summaries.
- The summaries are context, not evidence by themselves. Synthetic references \
  like "repository_summary", "subsystem_auth", or other non-file labels are \
  invalid.
- Never invent a file path. If you have not seen a path in the plan or \
  summaries above, do not cite it.

Output rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON array — no text before or after it.
- No markdown fences around the JSON.
- Every required title must appear exactly once.
