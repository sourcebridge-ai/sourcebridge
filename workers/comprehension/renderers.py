"""Artifact renderers.

A renderer takes a :class:`SummaryTree` and produces a final artifact
(cliff notes, learning path, code tour, workflow story). Renderers are
strategy-agnostic — they consume the tree shape, not knowledge of how
it was built — so the same CliffNotesRenderer works against a
HierarchicalStrategy output today and a RAPTOR/GraphRAG output later.

Each renderer does one final LLM call: it feeds the model the root
summary plus a small number of the most substantial child summaries
and asks for structured JSON sections that match the existing cliff
notes UI contract. This keeps the final prompt small enough for any
model even when the original repo was huge.

  - "content": a detailed markdown paragraph of 6-10 sentences. Name specific \
    files, components, functions, and patterns. Explain HOW things work, not \
    just WHAT they are. Minimum 120 words per section. (string)
  - "summary": a single-sentence takeaway (string)
  - "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low" (string)
  - "inferred": true if you're extrapolating beyond the summaries (boolean)
  - "evidence": array of objects with keys: source_type, source_id, file_path, \
    line_start, line_end, rationale. Every evidence entry must include an actual \
    repository file path from the summaries above.

Required section titles (produce every one, in this order):
{required_sections}

Confidence rules:
- Set confidence to "high" and inferred to false when the summaries above \
  directly describe what you're writing about and you can cite multiple real repo files.
- Treat the section evidence plan as the primary routing guide for what to inspect \
  for each section. The repository summary is orientation only.
- The summaries are context, not evidence by themselves. Synthetic references like \
  "repository_summary", "subsystem_auth", or other non-file labels are invalid.
- If you cannot cite real repo files for a claim, lower confidence and keep the \
  section narrow instead of inventing evidence.
- Only use "medium" when you are connecting dots NOT mentioned in any summary.
- Only use "low" when the summaries provide no relevant information at all.
- Do not force "high" confidence. Grounding quality matters more than completeness.

Output rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON array — no text before or after it.
- No markdown fences around the JSON.
- Every required title must appear exactly once.
