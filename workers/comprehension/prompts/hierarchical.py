"""Prompt templates for the hierarchical summarization strategy.

These prompts follow a few shared principles:

1. They are deliberately short. The leaf prompt runs once per
   segment on potentially thousands of chunks, so every token in the
   prompt multiplies cost and latency.

2. They target any reasonable instruction-following model including
   small local Ollama variants. No JSON mode required at the leaf
   level — free-text summaries are easier for weak models to produce
   reliably and the structure comes from the final renderer prompt.

3. Every level's output is itself an input to the next level's
   prompt, so the output shape has to stay stable and parseable:
   a headline line, a blank, then a 2-5 sentence body.

The final render prompt (in the renderers module) is responsible for
producing the structured sections the cliff notes UI expects.
