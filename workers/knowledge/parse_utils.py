"""Shared helpers for parsing LLM responses across the knowledge artifacts.

Cliff notes, learning path, code tour, and workflow story all parse
JSON returned from the model and need to coerce ints / preserve
identifiers / evaluate mechanical grounding criteria. Keeping the
helpers here means a bug fix (like the ``null`` line-number coerce
that originally took down cliff notes DEEP runs) propagates to every
artifact at once rather than being copy-pasted per module.
