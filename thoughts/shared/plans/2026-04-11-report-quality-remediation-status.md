# 2026-04-11 Report Quality Remediation Status

## Scope

This note tracks the live remediation work for poor enterprise report quality against the deployed `MACU Residence` report path at `https://sourcebridge-enterprise.xmojo.net`.

## Repo / Target

- Enterprise site: `https://sourcebridge-enterprise.xmojo.net`
- Repository under evaluation: `MACU Residence`
- Repository ID: `149fb476-6f73-4e66-ab6b-f18498197c73`

## What Was Fixed

- Wired `analysisDepth` end-to-end so report requests can actually run deep analyzers.
- Persisted report markdown and evidence in the DB instead of relying only on the filesystem.
- Fixed analyzer repo-path handling so deep analysis can use the live repo cache.
- Added real evidence return/persistence over the report path.
- Hardened section generation to fail closed for missing `cicd_detection` evidence instead of inventing deployment topology.
- Removed fake evidence markers, markdown fence leakage, and most repeated validation scaffolding.
- Added live benchmark harness and trend tracking in `benchmarks/results/report-quality-live/`.
- Curated the default `Architecture Baseline` section set for `C-Suite / Board` so the report no longer tries to force the full long-form section catalog into a one-repository baseline.
- Replaced more of the opening and governance-access material with deterministic descriptive rendering rather than open-ended synthesis.
- Cleaned the cover page and appendix output so the final document reads more like a baseline deliverable and less like an exported system artifact.
- Extended the same deterministic, descriptive rendering model to the other report types used by the enterprise wizard:
  - `swot`
  - `environment_eval`
  - `due_diligence`
  - `compliance_gap`
  - `portfolio_health`
- Added C-suite section curation for those report types so they no longer emit the full prompt-heavy templates by default.
- Excluded dedicated recommendation/remediation sections automatically when `includeRecommendations=false`.
- Increased the live benchmark harness poll timeout so long-running report types are less likely to fail due to harness-side HTTP timeouts.

## Current Recommendation

Use the curated descriptive worker behavior from `ent-20260412-001539` as the baseline.

Reason:

- It keeps the stronger trust boundary that earlier remediation introduced.
- It removes more of the obvious machine-shaped framing from the cover page, opening sections, and appendices.
- The curated section set is better aligned with a one-repository C-suite baseline and avoids low-value sections that previously made the document feel auto-generated.
- The same deterministic strategy now covers the non-baseline report types as well, so they no longer drift into long synthetic consultant prose.
- Remaining issues are now primarily editorial polish and a rollout-time worker readiness race, not factual trust or pipeline integrity.

## Current Live Worker Tag

- `ent-20260412-001539`

## Remaining Issues

- The opening summary is still more repository-metric-led than a strong human-authored baseline would be.
- Several section titles are inherited from the long-form template and are broader than the concise descriptive content now emitted under them.
- The appendices are cleaner, but they still read like internal evidence summaries rather than client-ready appendix prose.
- The live benchmark still occasionally records post-rollout transient gRPC dial failures because the API can enqueue work before the worker pod is fully listening on `50051`; these should be classified separately from content regressions.

## Suggested Next Moves

1. Add a stronger document-level editorial pass for the opening pages so executive text is less metric-led and more narrative while staying descriptive.

2. Review the `Architecture Baseline` section labels and either rename or collapse the ones that still sound broader than the evidence-backed content beneath them.

3. Improve appendix rendering from internal evidence snippets toward more polished appendix summaries.

4. Update the benchmark harness to separate:
   - transient worker-unavailable deployment race failures
   - content-quality regressions

## Validation Commands Used

- `go test ./internal/reports ./internal/api ./persistence`
- overlay worker pytest:
  - `PYTHONPATH="$tmpdir:/Users/jaystuart/dev/sourcebridge" .venv/bin/python -m pytest ...`
- live benchmark:
  - `make benchmark-report-quality-live REPORT_BASE_URL=https://sourcebridge-enterprise.xmojo.net REPORT_REPO_NAME='MACU Residence' REPORT_RESULTS_DIR=benchmarks/results/report-quality-live`
