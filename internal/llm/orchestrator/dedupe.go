// all. The JobStore's GetActiveByTargetKey is the durable backstop for
// cases where the orchestrator process has restarted but the DB still has
// an active record.
//
// The registry tracks job ids, not full job records, so it stays light.
// Callers resolve the id back to a full record via JobStore.GetByID.
